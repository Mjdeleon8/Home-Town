            My Hometown. In the first picture, the view with the rock is
            breathtaking, especially when you're on top of it. The second
            picture captures the enchanting Bantakay Falls in Atimonan, Quezon.
            I recall numerous memories from my childhood in my hometown,
            particularly spending time with my grandparents (lolo't lola).
            Whenever we visited, I cherished the moments spent swimming, as the
            sea was just a 2-minute walk from our house.
